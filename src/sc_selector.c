/* The scenario selector's pins and win marks.
 *
 * The selector draws its sprites afresh every frame in 03:de64, all through
 * the sprite-text emitter (COP 2), which writes each sprite of a record at
 * base + (dx, dy) into the next OAM slot:
 *
 *   record $12 at ($A0 - $16, $60)            the eight pins, from slot 0
 *   record $11 at ($DF10,X - $16, $DF00,X)    the selection bracket, only on
 *                                             the blink's on phase; on the off
 *                                             phase its slots keep their last
 *                                             positions with X bit 8 set, and
 *                                             that is how it hides
 *   record $29 at ($DF30,Y - $16, $DF20,Y)    one win mark per bit of $42,
 *                                             from slot 33
 *
 * A record is two flag bytes, two bits per sprite (bit 0: dx is negative,
 * bit 1: large), then (dx, dy, tile, attr) per sprite; an entry with dx = 0
 * and bit 0 set ends it early (tools/text_tool.py reads them the same way).
 * The record table is at $00:A164.
 *
 * Widescreen shows the cards the authentic view leaves out -- column 0 at the
 * left once the selector scrolls to $50, the Las Vegas column at the right at
 * $00 -- and the game draws their pins and marks as well, but raw OAM X cannot
 * tell them from the hidden bracket. So a renderer takes them from here:
 * every sprite the emitter writes for a pin or a mark, recomputed from the
 * records, at its true position. The scroll comes from the pin record's first
 * sprite, the Las Vegas pin in slot 0, so it is the value the displayed OAM
 * was built with, even mid-scroll.
 *
 * Sylt's card, the ninth, is the host's: no record knows it, so the game gives
 * it neither pin nor mark. Its pin has Rio's colour, since Sylt takes Rio's
 * entries elsewhere too (03:ce8b's seed), at the Las Vegas pin's place one
 * column (80 px) on; its mark is record $29 at Las Vegas's mark base one
 * column on, when bit 8 of $42 -- where the Sylt win is kept -- is set. */
